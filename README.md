# Pokébound

## What is this?

Pokébound is a Pokémon x Earthbound/Mother 2 ROM hack of the Pokémon game White 2, meant to make the dialogue of Pokémon White 2 have a more Earthbound-y feel.

## How can I play it?

Pokébound, like many ROM hacks, is built with the IPS patches! If you'd like to play the ROM yourself, then [download the latest .ips patch from the releases page](https://github.com/MCMi460/Pokebound/releases/latest) and patch the original ROM with [your favorite IPS patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/)!

## HOWEVER

> [!WARNING]
> **Pokébound is NOT a finished project! But _YOU_ can help!**

Be it through sharing the project or writing dialogue/code yourself, you can help!
